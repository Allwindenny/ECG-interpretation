# ECG-interpretation

The provided code includes multiple steps to load, preprocess, label, train, and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using ECG images. Below is a detailed explanation of the workflow and the accompanying decisions.



### 1. Loading and Displaying Images
The first snippet:
```python
# Folder path where PNG images are located
folder_path = '/Users/allwindenny/Downloads/ecg-image-kit-main/sample-data/ecg-images'

# List all files in the folder
image_files = [f for f in os.listdir(folder_path) if f.endswith('.png')]

# Load and display each image
for image_file in image_files:
    ...
```
Purpose:
- Load ECG images in the `.png` format.
- Display the images using Matplotlib, which helps in visually verifying the data quality.

### 2. Criteria for Classification Based on T-wave Morphology
This part attempts to classify ECG images as "Normal" or "Abnormal" based on extracted features like intensity and variance:
```python
# Approximate the T-wave region
t_wave_region = img[int(img.shape[0] * 0.4):int(img.shape[0] * 0.6), :]

# Properties of T-wave region
mean_intensity = np.mean(t_wave_region)
max_intensity = np.max(t_wave_region)
std_dev = np.std(t_wave_region)

# Threshold-based criteria for labeling
if mean_intensity < mean_threshold or max_intensity > max_threshold or std_dev > std_dev_threshold:
    labels.append(1)  # Abnormal
else:
    labels.append(0)  # Normal
```

Explanation:
- T-wave Morphology: ECG images show electrical signals from the heart. The T-wave represents the repolarization of the heart's ventricles, and abnormalities in this region could indicate issues like arrhythmias or ischemia.
- Metrics Used:
  - Mean Intensity: Average pixel intensity in the T-wave region to detect overall signal strength.
  - Max Intensity: Peak value to detect sharp or irregular T-waves.
  - Standard Deviation: Captures irregularities in wave morphology.

Challenges:
- This heuristic approach struggles with false positives or negatives due to variability in ECG patterns and noise.
- The technique may not generalize well and can mislabel images if thresholds are not tuned correctly.

### 3. Manual Labeling and Folder Structure
Since the automated labeling showed unreliable results, a manual labeling approach is implemented:
```python
folders = ["Training data", "Test data"]

# Create folders
for folder in folders:
    os.makedirs(os.path.join(main_dir, folder), exist_ok=True)

# Label images manually
for img_name in images:
    # Display the image and accept manual input for Normal/Abnormal
```
- Manual Labeling: Users visually inspect and label images into "Normal" or "Abnormal."
- Improved Data Organization: Images are split into training and testing datasets, creating a structured directory for reproducible results.

### 4. Building the CNN Model
A CNN is defined and trained to classify ECG images:
```python
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    ...
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Binary classification
])
```
- Layers:
  - Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial features.
  - Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions to avoid overfitting.
  - Dropout: Prevent overfitting by randomly disabling neurons.
  - Dense Layers: Perform final binary classification (Normal/Abnormal).
- Activation Function: Sigmoid is used in the final layer for binary classification.
- Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy, as it’s suitable for two-class problems.

---

### 5. Data Generators
For efficient memory usage, images are loaded in batches:
```python
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, rotation_range=15, ...)
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(...)
```
- Augmentation: Rotation, width/height shifts, and shearing improve model robustness by simulating real-world variability in ECG images.
- Normalization: Rescaling pixel values to `[0, 1]` ensures faster convergence during training.

---

### 6. Model Training and Evaluation
- Training:
  ```python
  history = model.fit(train_generator, validation_data=test_generator, epochs=10, ...)
  ```
  - The model is trained for 10 epochs with `adam` optimizer and accuracy tracking.
- Evaluation:
  ```python
  test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_generator)
  ```
  - The test accuracy indicates how well the model generalizes.

---

### 7. Performance Metrics
- Classification Report:
  ```python
  report = classification_report(true_labels, predictions, target_names=['Normal', 'Abnormal'])
  ```
  - Displays precision, recall, and F1-scores for each class.
- Confusion Matrix:
  ```python
  cm = confusion_matrix(true_labels, predictions)
  ```
  - Visualizes true/false positives and negatives, highlighting model performance.

---

### 8. Challenges and Recommendations
- Initial Failures: Heuristic labeling based on T-wave morphology was unreliable.
  - Solution: Manual labeling with a structured dataset helped improve performance.
- Improvements:
  - Augmentation ensures better generalization.
  - Batch Normalization can be added for faster convergence and stability.
  - Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with learning rates, epochs, and architecture.
